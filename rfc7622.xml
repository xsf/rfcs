  <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
    <t>The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) <xref
    target='RFC6120'/> is an application profile of the Extensible Markup
    Language <xref target="XML"/> for streaming XML data in close to real time
    between any two or more network-aware entities.  The address format for
    XMPP entities was originally developed in the Jabber open-source community
    in 1999, first described by <xref target='XEP-0029'/> in 2002, and then
    defined canonically by <xref target='RFC3920'/> in 2004 and <xref
    target='RFC6122'/> in 2011.</t>

    <t>As specified in RFCs 3920 and 6122, the XMPP address format used the
    "stringprep" technology for preparation and comparison of non-ASCII
    characters <xref target='RFC3454'/>.  Following the movement of
    internationalized domain names away from stringprep, this document defines
    the XMPP address format in a way that no longer depends on stringprep (see
    the Preparation, Enforcement, and Comparison of Internationalized Strings
    (PRECIS) problem statement <xref target='RFC6885'/>).  Instead, this
    document builds upon the internationalization framework defined by the
    IETF's PRECIS working group <xref target='RFC7564'/>.</t>

    <t>Although every attempt has been made to ensure that the characters
    allowed in Jabber Identifiers (JIDs) under stringprep are still allowed
    and handled in the same way under PRECIS, there is no guarantee of strict
    backward compatibility because of changes in Unicode and the fact that
    PRECIS handling is based on Unicode properties, not a hardcoded table of
    characters.  Because it is possible that previously valid JIDs might no
    longer be valid (or previously invalid JIDs might now be valid), operators
    of XMPP services are advised to perform careful testing before migrating
    accounts and other data (see Section 6 of <xref target='RFC7613'/>
    for guidance).</t>

    <section title="Fundamentals" anchor="addressing-fundamentals">
      <t>An XMPP entity is anything that can communicate using XMPP.  For
      historical reasons, the network address of an XMPP entity is called a
      JID.  A valid JID is a string of Unicode code points
      <xref target='Unicode'/>, encoded using UTF-8 <xref target='RFC3629'/>,
      and structured as an ordered sequence of localpart, domainpart, and
      resourcepart, where the first two parts are demarcated by the
      '@' character used as a separator and the last two parts are similarly
      demarcated by the '/' character (e.g.,
      &lt;juliet@example.com/balcony&gt;).</t>

      <t>The syntax for a JID is defined as follows, using the Augmented
      Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) as specified in <xref target="RFC5234"/>.</t>

      <t>All JIDs are based on the foregoing structure.  However, note that
      the formal syntax provided above does not capture all of the rules and
      restrictions that apply to JIDs, which are described below.</t>

      <t>Each allowable portion of a JID (localpart, domainpart, and
      resourcepart) is 1 to 1023 octets in length, resulting in a maximum
      total size (including the '@' and '/' separators) of 3071 octets.</t>

      <t><list style='empty'><t>Implementation Note: The length limits on JIDs
      and parts of JIDs are based on octets (bytes), not characters.  UTF-8
      encoding can result in more than one octet per character.</t></list></t> 

      <t><list style='empty'><t>Implementation Note: When dividing a JID into
      its component parts, an implementation needs to match the separator
      characters '@' and '/' before applying any transformation algorithms,
      which might decompose certain Unicode code points to the separator
      characters.</t></list></t> 

      <t><list style='empty'><t>Implementation Note: Reuse of the IP-literal
      rule from <xref target='RFC6874'/> implies that IPv6 addresses are
      enclosed within square brackets (i.e., beginning with '[' and ending
      with ']'), which was not the case with the definition of the XMPP
      address format in <xref target='RFC3920'/> but which was changed in
      <xref target='RFC6122'/>.  Also note that the IP-literal rule was
      updated between <xref target='RFC3986'/> and <xref target='RFC6874'/> to
      optionally add a zone identifier to any literal address.</t></list></t> 

      <t>This document defines the native format for JIDs; see <xref
      target="RFC5122"/> for information about the representation of a JID as
      a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) <xref target="RFC3986"/> or
      Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) <xref target="RFC3987"/> and
      the extraction of a JID from an XMPP URI or IRI.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Domainpart" anchor="addressing-domainpart">
      <t>The domainpart of a JID is the portion that remains once the
      following parsing steps are taken:</t>

      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>Remove any portion from the first '/' character to the end of the
          string (if there is a '/' character present).</t>

          <t>Remove any portion from the beginning of the string to the first
          '@' character (if there is an '@' character present).</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>This parsing order is important, as illustrated by example 15 in
      <xref target='addressing-examples'/>.</t>

      <t>The domainpart is the primary identifier and is the only REQUIRED
      element of a JID (a mere domainpart is a valid JID).  Typically, a
      domainpart identifies the "home" server to which clients connect for XML
      routing and data management functionality.  However, it is not necessary
      for an XMPP domainpart to identify an entity that provides core XMPP
      server functionality (e.g., a domainpart can identify an entity such as
      a multi-user chat service <xref target='XEP-0045'/>, a publish-subscribe
      service <xref target='XEP-0060'/>, or a user directory).</t>

      <t>The domainpart for every XMPP service MUST be a fully qualified
      domain name (FQDN), an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or an unqualified
      hostname (i.e., a text label that is resolvable on a local network).</t>

      <t><list style='empty'><t>Informational Note: The term "fully qualified
      domain name" is not well defined.  In <xref target='RFC1034'/>, it is
      also called an absolute domain name, and the two terms are associated in
      <xref target='RFC1535'/>.  The earliest use of the term can be found in
      <xref target='RFC1123'/>.  References to those older specifications
      ought not to be construed as limiting the characters of a
      fully qualified domain name to the ASCII range; for example, <xref
      target='RFC5890'/> mentions that a fully qualified domain name can
      contain one or more U-labels.</t></list></t> 

      <t><list style='empty'><t>Interoperability Note: Domainparts that are IP
      addresses might not be accepted by other services for the purpose of
      server-to-server communication, and domainparts that are unqualified
      hostnames cannot be used on public networks because they are resolvable
      only on a local network.</t></list></t>

      <t>If the domainpart includes a final character considered to be a label
      separator (dot) by <xref target='RFC1034'/>, this character MUST be
      stripped from the domainpart before the JID of which it is a part is
      used for the purpose of routing an XML stanza, comparing against another
      JID, or constructing an XMPP URI or IRI <xref target='RFC5122'/>. In
      particular, such a character MUST be stripped before any other
      canonicalization steps are taken.</t>

      <t>In general, the content of a domainpart is an Internationalized
      Domain Name (IDN) as described in the specifications for
      Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (commonly called
      "IDNA2008"), and a domainpart is an "IDNA-aware domain name slot" as
      defined in <xref target='RFC5890'/>.</t>

      <t>After any and all normalization, conversion, and mapping of code
      points as well as encoding of the string as UTF-8, a domainpart MUST NOT
      be zero octets in length and MUST NOT be more than 1023 octets in
      length.  (Naturally, the length limits of <xref target='RFC1034'/>
      apply, and nothing in this document is to be interpreted as overriding
      those more fundamental limits.)</t>

      <t>Detailed rules and considerations for preparation, enforcement, and
      comparison are provided in the following sections.</t>

      <section title="Preparation" anchor="addressing-domainpart-prep">
        <t>An entity that prepares a string for inclusion in an XMPP
        domainpart slot MUST ensure that the string consists only of Unicode
        code points that are allowed in NR-LDH labels or U-labels as defined
        in <xref target='RFC5890'/>.  This implies that the string MUST NOT
        include A-labels as defined in <xref target='RFC5890'/>; each A-label
        MUST be converted to a U-label during preparation of a string for
        inclusion in a domainpart slot.  In addition, the string MUST be
        encoded as UTF-8 <xref target='RFC3629'/>.</t>

      </section>
      <section title="Enforcement" anchor="addressing-domainpart-enforce">
        <t>An entity that performs enforcement in XMPP domainpart slots MUST
        prepare a string as described in
        <xref target="addressing-domainpart-prep"/> and MUST also apply
        the normalization, case-mapping, and width-mapping rules defined
        in <xref target='RFC5892'/>.</t>

        <t><list style='empty'><t>Informational Note: The order in which
        the rules are applied for IDNA2008 (see <xref target='RFC5892'/>
        and <xref target='RFC5895'/>) is different from the order for
        localparts and resourceparts as described under
        Sections <xref target='addressing-localpart' format="counter"/>
        and&nbsp;<xref target='addressing-resourcepart' format="counter"/>.
      </t></list></t>

      </section>
      <section title="Comparison" anchor="addressing-domainpart-comp">
        <t>An entity that performs comparison of two strings before or after
        their inclusion in XMPP domainpart slots MUST prepare each string
        as specified in <xref target="addressing-domainpart-prep"/> and then
        enforce the normalization, case&nbhy;mapping, and width-mapping rules
        specified in <xref target="addressing-domainpart-enforce"/>.
        The two strings are to be considered equivalent if they are an exact
        octet-for-octet match (sometimes called "bit-string identity").</t> 

      </section>
    </section>

    <section title='Localpart' anchor='addressing-localpart'>
      <t>The localpart of a JID is an optional identifier placed before the
      domainpart and separated from the latter by the '@' character.
      Typically, a localpart uniquely identifies the entity requesting and
      using network access provided by a server (i.e., a local account),
      although it can also represent other kinds of entities (e.g., a
      chatroom associated with a multi-user chat service <xref
      target='XEP-0045'/>).  The entity represented by an XMPP localpart is
      addressed within the context of a specific domain (i.e.,
      &lt;localpart@domainpart&gt;).</t>

      <t>The localpart of a JID MUST NOT be zero octets in length and MUST NOT
      be more than 1023 octets in length.  This rule is to be enforced after
      any normalization and mapping of code points as well as encoding of the
      string as UTF-8.</t>

      <t>The localpart of a JID is an instance of the UsernameCaseMapped
      profile of the PRECIS IdentifierClass, which is specified in <xref
      target='RFC7613'/>.  The rules and considerations provided in that
      specification MUST be applied to XMPP localparts.</t>

      <t><list style='empty'><t>Implementation Note: XMPP uses the Simple
      Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) <xref target='RFC4422'/> for
      authentication.  At the time of this writing, some SASL mechanisms use
      SASLprep <xref target='RFC4013'/> for the handling of usernames and
      passwords; in the future, these SASL mechanisms will likely transition to
      the use of PRECIS-based handling rules as specified in <xref
      target='RFC7613'/>.  For a detailed discussion about the implications
      of that transition (including the potential need to modify or remove
      certain characters in the underlying account database), see both
      Section 6 and Appendix A of <xref target='RFC7613'/>.</t></list></t>

      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Resourcepart" anchor="addressing-resourcepart">
      <t>The resourcepart of a JID is an optional identifier placed after the
      domainpart and separated from the latter by the '/' character.  A
      resourcepart can modify either a &lt;localpart@domainpart&gt; address or
      a mere &lt;domainpart&gt; address.  Typically, a resourcepart uniquely
      identifies a specific connection (e.g., a device or location) or object
      (e.g., an occupant in a multi-user chatroom <xref target='XEP-0045'/>)
      belonging to the entity associated with an XMPP localpart at a domain
      (i.e., &lt;localpart@domainpart/resourcepart&gt;).</t>

      <t>XMPP entities SHOULD consider resourceparts to be opaque strings and
      SHOULD NOT impute meaning to any given resourcepart.  In particular:</t>

      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>Use of the '/' character as a separator between the domainpart
          and the resourcepart does not imply that XMPP addresses are
          hierarchical in the way that, say, HTTP URIs are hierarchical (see
          <xref target='RFC3986'/> for general discussion); thus, for example,
          an XMPP address of the form &lt;localpart@domainpart/foo/bar&gt;
          does not identify a resource "bar" that exists below a resource
          "foo" in a hierarchy of resources associated with the entity
          "localpart@domainpart".</t>

          <t>The '@' character is allowed in the resourcepart and is often
          used in the "handle" shown in XMPP chatrooms <xref
          target='XEP-0045'/>.  For example, the JID
          &lt;room@chat.example.com/user@host&gt; describes an entity who is
          an occupant of the room &lt;room@chat.example.com&gt; with a handle
          of &lt;user@host&gt;.  However, chatroom services do not necessarily
          check such an asserted handle against the occupant's real JID.</t>

        </list>
      </t>
      <t>The resourcepart of a JID MUST NOT be zero octets in length and MUST
      NOT be more than 1023 octets in length.  This rule is to be enforced
      after any normalization and mapping of code points as well as encoding
      of the string as UTF-8.</t>

      <t>The resourcepart of a JID is an instance of the OpaqueString profile
      of the PRECIS FreeformClass, which is specified in
      <xref target='RFC7613'/>.  The rules and considerations provided in
      that specification MUST be applied to XMPP resourceparts.</t>


      <section title="Applicability to XMPP Extensions" anchor="addressing-resourcepart-applicability">
        <t>In some contexts, it might be appropriate to apply more restrictive
        rules to the preparation, enforcement, and comparison of XMPP
        resourceparts.  For example, in XMPP Multi-User Chat <xref
        target='XEP-0045'/> it might be appropriate to apply the rules
        specified in <xref target='PRECIS-Nickname'/>.  However, the
        application of more restrictive rules is out of scope for
        resourceparts in general and is properly defined in specifications for

       <postamble>Table 1: A Sample of Legal JIDs</postamble>
      </figure>

      <t>Several points are worth noting.  Regarding examples 6 and 7:
      although in German the character esszett (LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S
      (U+00DF)) can mostly be used interchangeably with the two characters
      "ss", the localparts in these examples are different, and (if desired) a
      server would need to enforce a registration policy that disallows one of
      them if the other is registered.  Regarding examples 9, 10, and 11:
      case-mapping of GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA (U+03A3) to lowercase (i.e.,
      to GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA (U+03C3)) during comparison would result in
      matching the JIDs in examples 9 and 10; however, because the PRECIS
      mapping rules do not account for the special status of GREEK SMALL
      LETTER FINAL SIGMA (U+03C2), the JIDs in examples 9 and 11 or examples
      10 and 11 would not be matched.  Regarding example 12: symbol characters
      such as BLACK CHESS KING (U+265A) are allowed by the PRECIS
      FreeformClass and thus can be used in resourceparts.  Regarding examples
      14 and 15: JIDs consisting of a domainpart and resourcepart are rarely
      seen in the wild but are allowed according to the XMPP address format.
      Example 15 illustrates the need for careful extraction of the domainpart
      as described in <xref target='addressing-domainpart'/>.</t>

      <t>The following examples illustrate strings that are not JIDs because
      they violate the format defined above.</t>

        <postamble>Table 2: A Sample of Strings That Violate the JID Rules</postamble>
      </figure>

      <t>Here again, several points are worth noting.  Regarding example 17:
      even though ASCII space (U+0020) is disallowed in the PRECIS
      IdentifierClass, it can be escaped to "\20" in XMPP localparts by using
      the JID Escaping rules defined in <xref target='XEP-0106'/>, as
      illustrated by example 5 in Table 1.  Regarding example 20: the Unicode
      character ROMAN NUMERAL FOUR (U+2163) has a compatibility equivalent of
      the string formed of LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049) and LATIN CAPITAL
      LETTER V (U+0056), but characters with compatibility equivalents are not
      allowed in the PRECIS IdentifierClass.  Regarding example 21: symbol
      characters such as BLACK CHESS KING (U+265A) are not allowed in the
      PRECIS IdentifierClass; however, both of the non-ASCII characters in
      examples 20 and 21 are allowed in the PRECIS FreeformClass and
      therefore in the XMPP resourcepart (as illustrated for U+265A by example
      12 in Table 1).  Regarding examples 22 and 23: the domainpart is
      required in a JID.</t>

  <section title="Enforcement in JIDs and JID Parts" anchor="enforcement">
    <t>Enforcement entails applying all of the rules specified in this
    document.  Enforcement of the XMPP address format rules is the
    responsibility of XMPP servers.  Although XMPP clients SHOULD prepare
    complete JIDs and parts of JIDs in accordance with this document before
    including them in protocol slots within XML streams, XMPP servers MUST
    enforce the rules wherever possible and reject stanzas and other XML
    elements that violate the rules (for stanzas, by returning a
    &lt;jid-malformed/&gt; error to the sender as described in Section 8.3.3.8
    of <xref target='RFC6120'/>).</t>

    <t>Entities that enforce the rules specified in this document are
    encouraged to be liberal in what they accept by following this
    procedure:</t>

    <t>
      <list style='numbers'>
        <t>Where possible, map characters (e.g., through width mapping,
        additional mapping, special mapping, case mapping, or normalization)
        and accept the mapped string.</t>

        <t>If mapping is not possible (e.g., because a character is disallowed
        in the FreeformClass), reject the string and return a
        &lt;jid-malformed/&gt; error.</t>

      </list>
    </t>
    <t>Enforcement applies to complete JIDs and to parts of JIDs.  To
    facilitate implementation, this document defines the concepts of "JID
    slot", "localpart slot", and "resourcepart slot" (similar to the concept
    of a "domain name slot" for IDNA2008 as defined in Section 2.3.2.6 of <xref
    target='RFC5890'/>):</t>

    <t>
      <list style='hanging'>
        <t hangText="JID Slot:">An XML element or attribute explicitly
        designated in XMPP or in XMPP extensions for carrying a complete
        JID.</t>

        <t hangText="Localpart Slot:">An XML element or attribute explicitly
        designated in XMPP or in XMPP extensions for carrying the localpart of
        a JID.</t>

        <t hangText="Resourcepart Slot:">An XML element or attribute
        explicitly designated in XMPP or in XMPP extensions for carrying the
        resourcepart of a JID.</t>

      </list>
    </t>
    <t>A server is responsible for enforcing the address format rules when
    receiving protocol elements from clients where the server is expected to
    handle such elements directly or to use them for purposes of routing a
    stanza to another domain or delivering a stanza to a local entity; two
    examples from <xref target='RFC6120'/> are the 'to' attribute on XML
    stanzas (which is a JID slot used by XMPP servers for routing of outbound
    stanzas) and the &lt;resource/&gt; child of the &lt;bind/&gt; element
    (which is a resourcepart slot used by XMPP servers for binding of a
    resource to an account for routing of stanzas between the server and a
    particular client).  An example from <xref target='RFC6121'/> is the 'jid'
    attribute of the roster &lt;item/&gt; element.</t>

    <t>A server is not responsible for enforcing the rules when the protocol
    elements are intended for communication among other entities, typically
    within the payload of a stanza that the server is merely routing to
    another domain or delivering to a local entity.  Two examples are the
    'initiator' attribute in the Jingle extension <xref target='XEP-0166'/>
    (which is a JID slot used for client-to-client coordination of multimedia
    sessions) and the 'nick' attribute in the Multi-User Chat extension <xref
    target='XEP-0045'/> (which is a resourcepart slot used for administrative
    purposes in the context of XMPP chatrooms).  In such cases, the entities
    involved SHOULD enforce the rules themselves and not depend on the server
    to do so, and client implementers need to understand that not enforcing
    the rules can lead to a degraded user experience or to security
    vulnerabilities.  However, when an add-on service (e.g., a multi-user chat
    service) handles a stanza directly, it ought to enforce the rules as well,
    as defined in the relevant specification for that type of service.</t>

    <t>This document does not provide an exhaustive list of JID slots,
    localpart slots, or resourcepart slots.  However, implementers of core
    XMPP servers are advised to consider as JID slots at least the following
    elements and attributes when they are handled directly or used for
    purposes of routing to another domain or delivering to a local entity:</t>

    <t>
      <list style='symbols'>
        <t>The 'from' and 'to' stream attributes and the 'from' and 'to'

        Discovery defined in <xref target='XEP-0030'/>.</t>

        <t>The &lt;value/&gt; element for Data Forms <xref

        &lt;impp/&gt; element for vCard 4.0 <xref target='XEP-0292'/> when the
        XML character data identifies an XMPP URI <xref
        target='RFC5122'/>.</t>

        <t>The 'from' attribute of the &lt;delay/&gt; element for Delayed
        Delivery <xref target='XEP-0203'/>.</t>

    <section title="Address Spoofing" anchor="security-spoofing">
      <t>There are two forms of address spoofing: forging and mimicking.</t>
      <section title="Address Forging" anchor="security-forging">
        <t>In the context of XMPP technologies, address forging occurs when an
        entity is able to generate an XML stanza whose 'from' address does not
        correspond to the account credentials with which the entity
        authenticated onto the network (or an authorization identity provided
        during negotiation of SASL authentication <xref target='RFC4422'/> as
        described in <xref target='RFC6120'/>).  For example, address forging
        occurs if an entity that authenticated as "juliet@im.example.com" is
        able to send XML stanzas from "nurse@im.example.com" or
        "romeo@example.net".</t> 

        <t>Address forging is difficult in XMPP systems, given the requirement
        for sending servers to stamp 'from' addresses and for receiving
        servers to verify sending domains via server-to-server authentication
        (see <xref target='RFC6120'/>).  However, address forging is possible
        if:</t>

        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>A poorly implemented server ignores the requirement for
            stamping the 'from' address.  This would enable any entity that
            authenticated with the server to send stanzas from any
            localpart@domainpart as long as the domainpart matches the sending
            domain of the server.</t>

            <t>An actively malicious server generates stanzas on behalf of any
            registered account at the domain or domains hosted at that
            server.</t>

          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Therefore, an entity outside the security perimeter of a particular
        server cannot reliably distinguish between JIDs of the form
        &lt;localpart@domainpart&gt; at that server and thus can authenticate
        only the domainpart of such JIDs with any level of assurance.  This
        specification does not define methods for discovering or counteracting
        the kind of poorly implemented or rogue servers just described.
        However, the end-to-end authentication or signing of XMPP stanzas
        could help to mitigate this risk, because it would require the rogue
        server to generate false credentials for signing or encryption of each
        stanza, in addition to modifying 'from' addresses.</t>

      </section>
      <section title="Address Mimicking" anchor="security-mimicking">
        <t>Address mimicking occurs when an entity provides legitimate
        authentication credentials for, and sends XML stanzas from, an account
        whose JID appears to a human user to be the same as another JID.
        Because many characters are visually similar, it is relatively easy to
        mimic JIDs in XMPP systems.  As one simple example, the localpart
        "ju1iet" (using the Arabic numeral one as the third character) might
        appear the same as the localpart "juliet" (using lowercase "L" as the
        third character).</t>

        <t>As explained in <xref target='RFC5890'/>, <xref target='RFC7564'/>,
        <xref target='UTR36'/>, and <xref target='UTS39'/>, there is no
        straightforward solution to the problem of visually similar
        characters.  Furthermore, IDNA and PRECIS technologies do not attempt
        to define such a solution.  As a result, XMPP domainparts, localparts,
        and resourceparts could contain such characters, leading to security
        vulnerabilities such as the following:</t>

        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>A domainpart is always employed as one part of an entity's
            address in XMPP.  One common usage is as the address of a server
            or server-side service, such as a multi-user chat service <xref
            target='XEP-0045'/>.  The security of such services could be
            compromised based on different interpretations of the
            internationalized domainpart; for example, a user might authorize
            a malicious entity at a fake server to view the user's presence
            information, or a user could join chatrooms at a fake multi-user
            chat service.</t>

            <t>A localpart can be employed as one part of an entity's address
            in XMPP.  One common usage is as the username of an instant
            messaging user; another is as the name of a multi-user chatroom;
            and many other kinds of entities could use localparts as part of
            their addresses.  The security of such services could be
            compromised based on different interpretations of the
            internationalized localpart; for example, a user entering a single
            internationalized localpart could access another user's account
            information, or a user could gain access to a hidden or otherwise
            restricted chatroom or service.</t>

            <t>A resourcepart can be employed as one part of an entity's
            address in XMPP.  One common usage is as the name for an instant
            messaging user's connected resource; another is as the nickname of
            a user in a multi-user chatroom; and many other kinds of entities
            could use resourceparts as part of their addresses.  The security
            of such services could be compromised based on different
            interpretations of the internationalized resourcepart; for
            example, two or more confusable resources could be bound at the
            same time to the same account (resulting in inconsistent
            authorization decisions in an XMPP application that uses full
            JIDs), or a user could send a private message to someone other
            than the intended recipient in a multi-user chatroom.</t>

          </list>
        </t>
        <t>XMPP services and clients are strongly encouraged to define and
        implement consistent policies regarding the registration, storage, and
        presentation of visually similar characters in XMPP systems.  In
        particular, service providers and software implementers are strongly
        encouraged to apply the policies recommended in <xref

    <section title="Differences from RFC 6122" anchor="diffs">
      <t>Based on consensus derived from working group discussion,
      implementation and deployment experience, and formal interoperability
      testing, the following substantive modifications were made from
      RFC&nbsp;6122.</t>

      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>Changed domainpart preparation to use IDNA2008 (instead of
          IDNA2003).</t>

          <t>Changed localpart preparation to use the UsernameCaseMapped
          profile of the PRECIS IdentifierClass (instead of the Nodeprep
          profile of stringprep).</t>

          <t>Changed resourcepart preparation to use the OpaqueString profile
          of the PRECIS FreeformClass (instead of the Resourceprep profile of
          stringprep).</t>

          <t>Specified that internationalized labels within domainparts must
          be U-labels (instead of "should be" U-labels).</t> 

          <t>Specified that fullwidth and halfwidth characters must be mapped
          to their decomposition mappings (previously handled through the use
          of Normalization Form KC).</t>

          <t>Specified the use of Unicode Normalization Form C (instead of
          Unicode Normalization Form KC as specified in the Nodeprep and
          Resourceprep profiles of stringprep).</t>

          <t>Specified that servers must enforce the address-formatting
          rules.</t>
